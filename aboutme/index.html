        <h3>background</h3>
        <p>I was born in 2001 in Atlanta, Georgia to a Chinese father and a white American mother. My father, who was born and raised in London, immigrated to the United States when he was 21, in 1990. My parents met not long after and had my brother, Timothy, in 1997. My father was naturalized when I was a young child. It is through him that my brother and I have dual nationality between the United States and the United Kingdom. I have resided in Chapel Hill since I was two years old.</p>
